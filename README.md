# Recipe Sharing System

This project is designed to streamline the process of creating and sharing recipes online, replacing traditional manual methods. Users can submit their recipes, which must be reviewed and approved by the admin before becoming publicly available. Once approved, the recipe can be edited or deleted only by the user who created it.
